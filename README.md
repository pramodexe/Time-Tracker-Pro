# Timer App

This app helps you track and improve at anything you want. You can create a category for each activity you care aboutâ€”like Rubik's Cube solving, doing pushups, practicing piano, or anything else.

For each category, you can time your sessions and see how you get better over time. The app keeps a log of all your attempts and shows you simple charts, so you can actually see your progress.

## What you can do

- Make a category for each thing you want to track (for example: "Rubik's Cube", "Pushups", "Piano Practice")
- Start a timer whenever you do that activity
- The app saves every session, so you can look back at your history
- See your best time, average time, and how many times you've practiced
- View easy-to-understand charts to watch your progress improve
- Switch between light and dark mode

## How to use it

1. **Create a category**
   - Click "New Category" and give it a name (like "10 Pushups")
2. **Start timing**
   - Click your category, then "New Session" to start the timer
   - Click "Start" when you begin, "Pause" if you need a break, and "Stop" when you're done
3. **Check your progress**
   - Look at the logs and charts for each category to see how you're improving over time

This way, you can easily monitor your progress in anything you want to get better at!
